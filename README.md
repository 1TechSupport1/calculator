It's a calculator!

Yea your computer dose come with a better one

But you can change  the colour of the buttons and the placement by changing the colour in the code over hear

                                             \/      \/                                      \/             \/
              button_1 = Button(text="1", padx=17, pady=12, command=lambda: number(1), fg="white", bg="#fc5e03")
                                             /\      /\                                     /\             /\
                                           size                                         font colur    button colur
                                                                                         
                                 \/        \/                                                 
               button_1.grid(row=4, column=0)  ---<<<placement
                                 /\        /\      
                                        
                                 change these values all similar lines of code 
                                 
                                 
                                                                                        
It's based of of tkinter fairly simple, and Im not the first to come up with this                                                                                       

And if it dosent work then try installing Tkinter on your pc with this command in your command promt or terminal 

                                              pip install tkinter
