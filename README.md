It's a calculator!

Yea your computer dose come with a better one

But you can change  the colour of the buttons and the placement by changing the colour in the code over hear

                                             \/      \/                                      \/             \/       i have used hex code hear for a more precice colour but you 
              button_1 = Button(text="1", padx=17, pady=12, command=lambda: number(1), fg="white", bg="#fc5e03")     use regular colur names if you want to
                                             /\      /\                                     /\             /\
                                           size                                         font colur    button colur
                                                                                         
                                 \/        \/                                                 
               button_1.grid(row=4, column=0)  ---<<<placement
                                 /\        /\      
                                        
                                 change these values all similar lines of code 
                                 
                                 
                                                                                        
It's based of of tkinter fairly simple, and Im not the first to come up with this                                                                                       

And tkinter comes  preinstalled in python 

    if it dose not work i don't know why ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
